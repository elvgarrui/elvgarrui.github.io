Nice to meet you! I'm a Software Engineer currently working at Red Hat Openstack.
My current focus is developing networking infrastructure for the cloud - This 
includes Neutron, which is the Openstack virtual networking component, and
also Openshift Operators, which we currently use for the control plane deployment of
Openstack (ovn-operator, neutron-operator...).

I enjoy side ~quests~ tasks too, like team coordination, and not just technical ones!
Working remotely can leave a bit of a sense of loneliness and I find them nice to
balance those *sad vibes*.

On my free time I like doing some silly art (like the little bird you can see on
the bottom-right of this page), petting any animal that exists, playing games
and, above all, spending quality time with family and friends.
