I'm a Software Engineer currently working at Red Hat Openstack.
My work right now is developing networking infrastructure for the cloud - This 
includes Neutron, which is the Openstack virtual networking component, and
also Openshift Operators, which we currently use for the control plane deployment of
Openstack (ovn-operator, neutron-operator...).

Beside technical work, I also enjoy side ~quests~ tasks. This can include coordinating cross-teams
or improving communication and/or knowledge-sharing whithin a team. Working remotely can 
leave a bit of a sense of loneliness and I find them nice to find some *balance*.

On 2022 I attended OpenInfraSummit Berlin to give a talk: [Contributing to Neutron 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkPVGYo5wco).
I have also given [some talks](https://nitter.net/sugus_etsii/status/1497285455234146311#m)
at my local university related to open source, because I belonged to the free and open
source software association (SUGUS GNU/LINUX) during my student period.

On my free time I like doing some silly art (like the little bird you can see on
the bottom of this page), petting any animal that exists on earth, playing games
and, above all, spending quality time with family and friends.
