Linux System Roles are a collection of roles and modules that assist Linux
administrators in the configuration of GNU/Linux subsystems through Ansible.
There are roles for managing different parts of the systems such as selinux,
storage and networking.

### Improving the Network Linux System Role

My main objective was to improve the Network Linux System Role. Although my
proposal covered the many different tasks that were suggested for the project,
my mentors and I decided to better focus on improving the integration testing
of the project. Therefore, most of my contributions were related to this
matter. Adding Pytest as an integration testing tool is the most remarkable addition
to the project. Below you can see the detailed list of my contributions:

#### Merged PRs

Started before 1st May, 2020:

- [**PR207 - Separate debug and info logs from
  warnings**](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/pull/207): Fixes
[Issue 29](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/issues/29).

After 1st May, 2020:
- [**PR226 -  Update contributing.md with steps to
  contributing**](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/pull/226).

- [**PR223 - Change ethtool features to use
  underscores**](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/pull/223).
Refers to [Issue
206](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/issues/206). The role now
accepts properties written with underscores or dashes, and fails if both options
are mixed.

- [**PR237 - Fail if state and persistent_state are
  incompatible**](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/pull/237):
Fixes [Issue 205](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/issues/205).

- [**PR251 - Fix error message format**](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/pull/251).
 
- [**PR260 - Add Pytest integration
  tests**](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/pull/260): This PR
contains two different commits. The first one creates the script for testing
and the [mocking of the Ansible
runtime](http://elviragruiz.net/2020/07/20/mocking-ansible-python.html). The
second one consists of playbooks that allow Pytest to run in the
project-internal test-harness. The test-harness allows the execution of these
tests in different Linux distributions such as CentOS, Fedora and RHEL.

### Todo

There are some tasks that still need to be finished. The most important is to
add Python 2 support to the Pytest integration testing, which is needed to be
able to test older releases of THEL or CentOS. After that, I also want to
finish [Issue 206](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/network/issues/206) by
adding warnings when a deprecated property is used.

### üå§Ô∏è  Summer is ending... üå§Ô∏è 

It has been an intense but rewarding summer, and I've learnt a lot. I've been able to work directly with awesome professionals. I'm willing to continue contributing to Linux System Roles and to improve my skills as a software engineer!!

*Thanks to Fedora and all the mentors. Thanks to Till for being so understanding and patient with me. I really appreciate all the time you have dedicated to my mentoring.*
